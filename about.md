Hi! My name is Ana Marija and I come from Ljubljana, Slovenia. Not so long ago, I was a TV journalist with a bachelor's degree in Food science and technology. These days my passion is everything product design related.

Being a perfectionist, having a great appreciation for the general aesthetic of things and coming from technology, my path was already set towards product design. It was initiated by finishing a six-month course in UI design from CareerFoundry where I was able to collaborate with the industry's leading professionals as my mentors. One of them taught me to "Start slow and finish fast", emphasizing the meaning of research before starting the visual part of the design process and firlmy understanding all design choices, which is why I'm a strong adherent of lean UX.

Since then I've accumulated experience working in three software development agencies and also had a taste of freelancing. From UI I moved on to UX and finally product management which is my main focus nowadays.
